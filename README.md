# lutris_unopened
Let you execute and setup (only if the .exe isn't on it yet) your .exe files from Lutris without opening it. (Just have to click on the .exe)

# /!\ Important
For now the app is not fully compatible with Lutris Flatpak (Wine versions can't be chosen).

Multi-setups aren't supported yet.


# How to use it
- Make aoi.sh the default .exe launcher, that's it!
