# Lutris Unopened
Let you execute and setup (only if the .exe isn't on it yet) your .exe files from Lutris without opening it. (You just have to click on the .exe).

# /!\ Important
For now the app is not fully compatible with Lutris Flatpak (Wine versions can't be chosen).

Multi-setups aren't supported yet.


# How to use it
- Have Lutris installed.
- Make aoi.sh the default .exe launcher, that's it!
